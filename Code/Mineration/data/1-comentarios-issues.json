This is obviously more XML than just adding a property but is arguably easier to understand.\n\nThe whole point of this commit is that your suggested way does _not_ work and extracting the version into a property is the only way to achieve library upgrades. Dependency versions specified in a `<dependencyManagement />` block are enforced by Maven. Locally defined version numbers are not considered at all. Thus there's no way to tweak the dependency version in the user project. \n\nWhile I can perfectly understand the basic reasoning it's usually the lower version bound you want to enforce. However assume we fix a critical bug in a Spring Data library and release it. If there's no way for the user to upgrade to that bug fix version except waiting for a Boot release, Boot is more of an annoyance than a help. So while I am totally with you that altering the version is probably not something you want to start with but it definitely is something users will want to do. Even more for third party dependencies, whose release lifecycle we don't control.\n\nI'd argue that if someone takes the time to lookup the property to override and manually declares and configures the property locally, she knows what she's doing. I don't expect people to abuse the functionality to deliberately pull in unsupported library versions such as Spring 3, HIbernate 3 or the like.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/comments/22671247/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/comments/22672233","html_url":"https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/pull/24#issuecomment-22672233","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/24","id":22672233,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNjcyMjMz","user":{"login":"philwebb","id":519772,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxOTc3Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/519772?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/philwebb","html_url":"https://github.com/philwebb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philwebb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philwebb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philwebb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philwebb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philwebb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philwebb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philwebb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philwebb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philwebb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-08-14T22:25:04Z","updated_at":"2013-08-14T22:25:04Z","body":"Does redeclaring the dependencyManagement section not work for you?\n\nFor example, using the sample from the README\n\n```\n$ mvn dependency:list | grep spring-core\n[INFO]    org.springframework:spring-core:jar:4.0.0.M2:compile\n```\n\nAfter adding:\n\n```\n    <dependencyManagement>\n        <dependencies>\n            <dependency>\n                <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>\n                <artifactId>spring-core</artifactId>\n                <version>4.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT</version>\n            </dependency>\n        </dependencies>\n    </dependencyManagement>\n```\n\n```\n$ mvn dependency:list | grep spring-core\n[INFO]    org.springframework:spring-core:jar:4.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT:compile\n```\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/comments/22672233/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/comments/22686096","html_url":"https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/pull/24#issuecomment-22686096","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/24","id":22686096,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNjg2MDk2","user":{"login":"odrotbohm","id":128577,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODU3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/128577?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/odrotbohm","html_url":"https://github.com/odrotbohm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odrotbohm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odrotbohm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odrotbohm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odrotbohm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odrotbohm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odrotbohm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odrotbohm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odrotbohm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odrotbohm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-08-15T05:35:12Z","updated_at":"2013-08-15T05:35:20Z","body":"Admittedly, I haven't thought about adding a `<dependencyManagement />` block but if that's the solution to the problem there's \n\na) no aspect of being opinionated here anymore as you can screw up the version just as you could do with the properties approach and\nb) were exposing 9 lines of XML to a user which can be simply 1 with the properties approach.

You could fix this in your `web.xml` (in the servlet declaration)\n\n```\n<init-param>\n    <param-name>contextInitializerClasses</param-name>\n    <param-value>org.springframework.boot.context.initializer.ConfigFileApplicationContextInitializer</param-value>\n</init-param>\n```\n\nIt's probably better though to add a `SpringBootServletInitializer`, since that way you are always going to get all the features of `SpringApplication` in your web context (then you would use a Servlet 3.0 container - so no need for web.xml). Your `SampleWebApplication` could extend `SpringBootServletInitializer` and just return an array containing its own class (that's a pretty common pattern for these \"hybrid\"

How to: 1) detect that the user wants to enable a webSocket MessageBroker; 2) decide whether to add a broker relay and what to do with the simple broker. With 2), maybe the user wants us to enable a broker relay for production use, but use a simple broker with the same routing keys if in development. Spring profiles seem like an obvious way to approach that, but Spring Boot does not currently bless any special profile names, and I prefer not to create a precedent. Also maybe that's _not_ what the user wants. 1) is  also tricky, even if Spring made bean definition class metadata searchable (it doesn't as far as I know), because it isn't obvious that a webSocket MessageBroker is the intended recipient of `@MessageMapping` or `@SubscribeEvent`. On the other hand, I suppose, arguably the developer who adds a `@MessageMapping` is happy to get a message from any source, so maybe it would be OK to always `setAnnotationMethodDestinationPrefixes`.

In a web app, there's no way to reuse a configuration class annotated with `@EnableAutoConfiguration` in test scenarios as this will always bootstrap the entire web container. This is way more than needed if all you want to test is your entity mapping and a bunch of query methods.\n\nThe sample code Eberhard found, apparently is from the repositories-deepdive project. I found out the necessary Initializer classes needed to successfully inspect the Boot config files during application context startup. So while this enables you to run the Spring test context framework and run Boot alongside it, this is not a solution for the aforementioned problem.\n\nI think we should make sure that developers can use the test context framework as before. I don't even think I'd want to have a custom runner or enumerate the necessary listeners myself. We might have to get @sbrannen into the loop. In the best case the test context frameworks detects Boot in the classpath and configures itself automatically. If that is a no-go, we probably should go with something custom to Boot.\n\nNot sure it's the most elegant solution but I can imagine an enum indicating which parts to bootstrap:\n`PERSISTENCE`, `WEB`, `CONTAINER`. The latter being inclusive of the former. On the other hand, detecting `@WebConfiguration` should be sufficient to indicate you want to use Spring Web MVC testing support.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/comments/25539686/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/comments/25540187","html_url":"https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/pull/60#issuecomment-25540187","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/60","id":25540187,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NTQwMTg3","user":{"login":"odrotbohm","id":128577,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODU3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/128577?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/odrotbohm","html_url":"https://github.com/odrotbohm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odrotbohm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odrotbohm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odrotbohm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odrotbohm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odrotbohm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odrotbohm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odrotbohm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odrotbohm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odrotbohm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-10-02T13:56:04Z","updated_at":"2013-10-02T13:56:04Z","body":"You're right guys, we had to [upgrade Boot](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/commit/604b9069b135a584eda42df11f834f2f9096786f) due to some changes in the latest Spring Data Commons (changes, that actually were introduced due to the boot team asking for them :).\n\nWe're heading towards a 2.0 release for SD REST in the Codd [release train](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-commons/wiki/Release-planning) (dates on the linked wiki page).\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/comments/25540187/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/comments/25547326","html_url":"https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/66#issuecomment-25547326","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/66","id":25547326,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NTQ3MzI2","user":{"login":"dsyer","id":124075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDA3NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/124075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsyer","html_url":"https://github.com/dsyer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsyer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsyer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsyer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsyer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsyer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsyer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsyer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsyer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsyer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-10-02T15:17:06Z","updated_at":"2013-10-02T15:17:06Z","body":"Yeah, I'm not sure I like the enumeration either - I think the choice comes down to web or not-web.

If you want to contribute some documentation that would be great. Generally, though, can you post general HOWTO questions on stackoverflow (easier for people to find them for reference in the future), please?\n\nOne thing is unusual about your application: it doesn't have a Spring DispatcherServlet. Maybe that's common in Vaadin land (I have no experience with that)., but it isn't common in general. That's not to say that you can't convert you app, but it might not be suitable as a case study for Spring MVC apps in general.\n\nThe first thing you have to decide is what the target is. Do you want an executable JAR, or a WAR? If the former, then maybe the latter is a useful first step anyway.\n\nYou should be able to just create an application configuration main class (like the samples and guides) and import the XML file to get started. To run as a WAR in a container you will need a `SpringBootServletInitializer`. That will get you something that runs, but won't be serving your resources yet. Then you can probably start removing stuff from the XML that Boot already provides by autoconfiguration. Without access to the file it's hard to say how smoothly that would go.\n\nA `Servlet` is added to a Spring Boot standalone application by adding a `@Bean` of type `Servlet` (or `ServletRegistrationBean` for more control of mapping and parameters).\n\nThis application only has one servlet. What is the purpose of the /\\* mapping? Normally this would be a Spring DispatcherServlet in an autoconfigured Boot application, so that will be the only complicated piece. I imagine you can probably just create a `@Bean` definition for it, but you will have to take steps to disable the default `DispatcherServlet`. Looking at `DispatcherServletAutoConfiguration` I'd say you might only be able to do that by declaring your own `DispatcherServlet` and mapping it to an unused path. (Or if `SpringVaadinServlet` actually _is_ a `DispatcherServlet`, forgive my ignorance, then just declaring it with bean id \"dispatcherServlet\" would be enough.)\n\nI'm happy to work with you to make this easier if it turns out to be hard for no good reason.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/comments/29371501/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/comments/29371689","html_url":"https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/136#issuecomment-29371689","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/136","id":29371689,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MzcxNjg5","user":{"login":"dsyer","id":124075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDA3NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/124075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsyer","html_url":"https://github.com/dsyer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsyer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsyer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsyer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsyer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsyer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsyer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsyer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsyer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsyer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-11-27T09:48:56Z","updated_at":"2013-11-27T09:48:56Z","body":"What does you app need those settings for, and how do you know they were ignored (AFAIK this is handled in the JVM itself, and nothing to do with Spring)? `JAVA_OPTS` should be included by the CLI (of you use the `spring` shell script that we provide).

I also display the java version and the start time, and, in the case of the proxied system, I explicitly set `JAVA_OPTS` with the proxy values.

The proxied system hangs for ~ 4 minutes, with just the one connection attempt showing, then fails with a stack trace indicating a connection time-out.\nNote the connection attempt is to port 80/http rather than to 8080/http-alt, as you would expect if the JVM heeded the proxy settings.\nMy guess is the JVM picks up the proxy settings allright, but the connection has to be made using these proxy settings explicitly (if they exist).\n![0-spring-boot-with-direct-internet-access](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1206974/1632209/6365e7da-5774-11e3-8361-31192e6d85b1.png)\n![1-spring-boot-behind-proxy](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1206974/1632210/6811c452-5774-11e3-9433-062d687defb3.png)\n![2-spring-boot-behind-proxy-stack-trace](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1206974/1632211/6a92230c-5774-11e3-966d-71fb758da035.png)\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/comments/29390538/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/comments/29391389","html_url":"https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/137#issuecomment-29391389","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/137","id":29391389,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MzkxMzg5","user":{"login":"dsyer","id":124075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDA3NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/124075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsyer","html_url":"https://github.com/dsyer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsyer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsyer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsyer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsyer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsyer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsyer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsyer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsyer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsyer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-11-27T15:11:21Z","updated_at":"2013-11-27T15:11:21Z","body":"OK, so now the app on my branch is starting and the home page looks OK (hard to say since I don't I don't know what it is supposed to do).

There maybe a better solution, but lets talk about the case.\nWhile deploying Spring-XD to EC2 1 Admin, 1 Container, the container failed to connect to the redis server.  While investigating I noticed that the container's spring.redis.host had not been changed even though the spring_redis_host   environment variable was set.   What I found was that if I updated the application.yml spring: redis: host: the application would recognize the new host.\n\nSo I debugged the application and found that the PropertiesConfigurationFactory was filtering out the environment variables that contained a _ or a .   So for example spring_redis_port would be filtered by while port would not.\n\nBy adding the *_, the environment variable was allowed through and thus the application would use the spring_redis_host and spring_redis_port.  \n\nDoes this make sense?\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/comments/30163689/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/comments/30210756","html_url":"https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/156#issuecomment-30210756","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/156","id":30210756,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMjEwNzU2","user":{"login":"dsyer","id":124075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDA3NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/124075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsyer","html_url":"https://github.com/dsyer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsyer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsyer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsyer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsyer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsyer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsyer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsyer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsyer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsyer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-12-10T09:32:41Z","updated_at":"2013-12-10T09:32:41Z","body":"I don't think jetty-servlets is included in the Spring Boot starter.

action.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/comments/30515267/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/comments/30519112","html_url":"https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/162#issuecomment-30519112","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/162","id":30519112,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNTE5MTEy","user":{"login":"tkruse","id":1525116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjUxMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1525116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse","html_url":"https://github.com/tkruse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-12-13T15:50:18Z","updated_at":"2013-12-13T15:50:18Z","body":"To

don't think this is really a problem, except for the user that has to do all the manual build configuration. Log4J _is_ supported by the underlying spring-boot library. So if you really prefer to use it for logging you don't have to use the \"starter\" dependencies to use Spring Boot - they are curated dependency sets for getting started quickly. If you really don't like logback (our preference) then you need to exclude logback from the web starter and log4j-over-slf4j from the actuator starter. Or you can include only the spring-boot bits you like (spring-boot-actuator on its own for instance has no dependency on a logging framework other than the commons-logging API, like most Spring projects).\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/comments/30584251/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}
